# ByBit_Smart_Pillow

## Description
The ByBit Smart Pillow is an innovative crypto-alerting device built with an ESP32 microcontroller, designed for crypto enthusiasts who want to stay informed even while they rest. This smart pillow allows users to monitor cryptocurrency price movements and receive alerts when certain conditions are met.

## Features
 - Crypto Price Tracking: Users can select specific cryptocurrencies and set custom triggers for price changes (e.g., 2% or 5%). If a selected cryptocurrency reaches the set threshold, the pillow vibrates to alert the user.
 - AP Mode Access: The device hosts an access point (AP), allowing users to connect directly to its interface and configure settings.
 - Wi-Fi Setup: Through the access point interface, users can also configure Wi-Fi settings to enable more extended functionality.

## Technical Details
 - Controller: Powered by an ESP32, providing both Wi-Fi connectivity and power efficiency.
 - Interface: The AP interface allows users to set up alerts, connect to local Wi-Fi, and monitor the device.

This project combines comfort and functionality, offering a unique way to keep up with crypto markets without needing constant screen time.
